## raw stats: self exploration: 

* trie /tree struct of the commands and all options used
    * common subcommands of stuff like git, docker, etc.
* counts of each command: [x] python 
* most diverse commands? [x] python
* most often repeated?

### if timestamped

* histogram of when you ran each command over whole time and over the week and daily
    * filter by specific commands (top 10), at the same time? like a STATS multi-PDF
* time between / within specific commands sequences?


## Funner, "haha" look at this: 

* longest command (characterwise) [x] python
* vim or emacs? [x] python
* longest streak of the same command
* start from the top: how many commands started with `/` [x] python
* one offs: commands only executed once [x] python
* copy paste errors? looks like code, or starts with spaces?
* what specifically started with sudo! [x] python
* whups: same command, followed by same command but with sudo before
* multiple lines

## Misc / kinda specific:

* How many `..`s
* any pipes? 
* clear /exits /tput reset
* common mispellings of commands
* windows specific? mac specific? ununtu specific?
* urls? 
* treat ls and cd separately?
